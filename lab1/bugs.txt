    url_decode(reqpath, sp1);
    sp1 holds the pointer to the requested address part of the request line.
    there is no check for the reqpath length in url_decode, which means reqpath as a stack variable can be overflowed.
    this can be prevented by stack canaries.

[http.c:159]
    url_decode(value, sp);
    sp holds the parsed "value" of the header element "name: value"
    there is no check for the value length, which means reqpath as a stack variable can be overflowed.
    this can be prevented by stack canaries.

[http.c:165]
    sprintf(envvar, "HTTP_%s", buf);
    envvar is 512 bytes long and stored in the stack.
    buf would normally store the "name" of "name: value"
    since buf is 8192 bytes long (stored in vss) it can be used to overflow envvar
    since it does not check for the length.
    this can be prevented by stack canaries.

[http.c:477]
    setenv(env, p, 1);
    this stores the pair "AAAA=BBBB" as an environment variable with name
    "AAAA" and value "BBBB" while it parses the request line.
    This can be used to store bytecode as an environmental variable,
    then combined with other overflow exploit to point to this bytecode.
    this cannot be prevented by stack canaries.

[http.c:477]
    setenv(env, p, 1);
    this stores the pair "AAAA: BBBB" as an environment variable with name
    "AAAA" and value "BBBB" while it parses the headers.
    This can be used to store bytecode as an environmental variable,
    then combined with other overflow exploit to point to this bytecode.
    this cannot be prevented by stack canaries.

[http.c:282]
    strcat(pn,name);
    name is a given REQUEST_URI as inputted and processed by the program.
    if it is long enough pn which has a length of 1024 can be overflowed.

[http.c:165]
    snprintf(envvar, 512, "HTTP_%s", buf);
    since envvar is 512 bytes long buf only writes the first 512-5-1 = 506 chars into envvar
